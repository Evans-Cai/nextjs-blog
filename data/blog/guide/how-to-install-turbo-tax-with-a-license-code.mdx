### Locate Your TurboTax License Code

Before you begin, make sure you have your TurboTax license code handy. This code is essential for activating the software. You can find it in a few places depending on how you purchased TurboTax:

- **TurboTax Account**: Log in to your Intuit account. You’ll find the license code under your purchase history.

Having this code ready will save you time during the installation process.

> **Tip**: Keep your license code in a safe place. You might need it again if you reinstall TurboTax or switch to a new computer.

### Download TurboTax from the Official Website

Once you’ve located your license code, the next step is to download TurboTax. Follow these steps to ensure you’re getting the official version:

### Enter Your License Code to Activate TurboTax

Even though installing TurboTax with a license code is usually smooth, you might run into a few hiccups. Don’t worry—most issues are easy to fix. Let’s go over some common problems and how you can solve them.

### Resolving License Code Errors

If you’re having trouble with your license code, it’s often due to a small mistake. Here’s how you can resolve these errors:

- **Double-check the code**: Make sure you’ve entered the license code exactly as it appears. Look out for common mistakes like confusing the letter "O" with the number "0."
- **Verify your purchase source**: Ensure you’re using a valid code from an official source, like your email receipt, the TurboTax box, or your Intuit account.
- **Check your internet connection**: A weak or unstable connection can prevent the code from being verified. Try reconnecting to a stronger network.

> **Tip**: If you’re still stuck, restart the software and try entering the code again. Sometimes, a simple restart can fix the issue.
> 

### Fixing Download or Installation Problems

Sometimes, downloading or installing TurboTax doesn’t go as planned. Here’s how you can troubleshoot these problems:

1. **Clear your browser cache**: If the download won’t start, clearing your browser’s cache can help. This removes temporary files that might be causing the issue.
2. **Disable antivirus software temporarily**: Some antivirus programs might block the installation. Turn it off temporarily, but don’t forget to turn it back on afterward.
3. **Run the installer as an administrator**: Right-click the downloaded file and select "Run as Administrator." This gives the installer the permissions it needs to work properly.
4. **Check your system requirements**: Make sure your computer meets the minimum requirements for TurboTax. If it doesn’t, the installation might fail.

> **Note**: If you’re switching from a CD to an online download, you’ll need to uninstall any partially installed files before starting fresh.
