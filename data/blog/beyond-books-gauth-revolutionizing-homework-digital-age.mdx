## Contemporary Method for Homework
Over the years, homework's importance in college has evolved dramatically. 
Assignments nowadays cannot be adequate to just repeat what was taught in class. Rather, assignments should pique interest, encourage involvement, and advance more thorough knowledge. These important factors should help define homework in the context of modern education:

Homework should push students to investigate several points of view, evaluate material, and come to their own opinions. Gauth gives students interesting, provocative challenges that inspire critical thinking and research in many disciplines.

Projects requiring group discussions, peer evaluations, or group projects help students to feel a part of something. Gauth helps students to tackle difficult ideas together, share ideas and learn from one another.
