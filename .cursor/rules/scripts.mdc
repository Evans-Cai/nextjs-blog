# scripts Directory Guide

The [scripts/](mdc:scripts) directory contains Node.js scripts for build and post-build tasks:

- [rss.mjs](mdc:scripts/rss.mjs): Generates the RSS feed for the blog.
- [postbuild.mjs](mdc:scripts/postbuild.mjs): Post-build script (details in file).

Use these scripts for automating content generation and deployment tasks.
