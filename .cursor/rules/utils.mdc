# utils Directory Guide

The [utils/](mdc:utils) directory contains utility functions and data helpers:

- General utilities (e.g., [skill-image.js](mdc:utils/skill-image.js), [time-converter.js](mdc:utils/time-converter.js), [check-email.js](mdc:utils/check-email.js)).
- [data/](mdc:utils/data): Contains structured data for skills, contacts, education, experience, and projects.

Use these utilities and data helpers throughout the app for common logic and data access.
