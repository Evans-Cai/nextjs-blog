# 101 GitHub 存储库-有用存储库的绝对列表

这是我多年来编写的列表，其中包含我发现有用或有趣的所有内容。

没有特殊的分类，它流向 JS 端，但几乎没有。

请随时发表评论并添加您喜欢的仓库。

以下是不按顺序排列的列表：

### 1 <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/conwnet/github1s">github1s</a>

Fresh out of the Owen,
One second to read GitHub code with VS Code.

### 2 <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rough-stuff/rough">Rough.js</a>

Rough.js is a small (&lt;9 kB) graphics library that lets you draw in a sketchy, hand-drawn-like, style. The library defines primitives to draw lines, curves, arcs, polygons, circles, and ellipses. It also supports drawing SVG paths.

### 3 <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/valeriansaliou/sonic">Sonic</a>

### 4 <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/brotandgames/ciao">ciao</a>

ciao checks HTTP(S) URL endpoints for a HTTP status code (or errors on the lower TCP stack) and sends a notification on status change via E-Mail or Webhooks.

<p>It uses Cron syntax to schedule the checks and comes along with a Web UI and a RESTful JSON API.

### 5 <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/auchenberg/vscode-browser-preview">Browser Preview for VS Code</a>

Browser Preview for VS Code enables you to open a real browser preview inside your editor that you can debug. Browser Preview is powered by Chrome Headless, and works by starting a headless Chrome instance in a new process. This enables a secure way to render web content inside VS Code, and enables interesting features such as in-editor debugging and more!

### 6 <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch">Hoppscotch </a>

This is a script that generates an interactive geo heatmap from your Google location history data using Python, Folium and OpenStreetMap.

### 9 <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/chatwoot/chatwoot">Chatwoot </a>

Chatwoot is an open-source omnichannel customer support software. The development of Chatwoot started in 2016. It failed to succeed as a business and eventually shut up shop in 2017. During 2019 #Hacktoberfest, the maintainers decided to make it open-source, instead of letting the code rust in a private repo. With a pleasant surprise, Chatwoot became a trending project on Hacker News and best of all, got lots of love from the community. Now, a failed project is back on track and the prospects are looking great. The team is back to working on the project and this time, we are building it in the open. Thanks to the ideas and contributions from the community.

### 10 <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/cloudflare/flan">Flan Scan</a>

Flan Scan is a lightweight network vulnerability scanner. With Flan Scan you can easily find open ports on your network, identify services and their version, and get a list of relevant CVEs affecting your network.

<p>Flan Scan is a wrapper over Nmap and the vulners script which turns Nmap into a full-fledged network vulnerability scanner. Flan Scan makes it easy to deploy Nmap locally within a container, push results to the cloud, and deploy the scanner on Kubernetes.

### 11 <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/andrew--r/channels">YOUTUBE - channels for frontend developers </a>

A collection of useful YouTube channels and other videos sources for JavaScript developers and web designers.

### 12 <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/denysdovhan/wtfjs">wtfjs</a>

A list of funny and tricky JavaScript examples

<p>JavaScript is a great language. It has a simple syntax, large ecosystem and, what is most important, a great community.
<p>At the same time, we all know that JavaScript is quite a funny language with tricky parts. Some of them can quickly turn our everyday job into hell, and some of them can make us laugh out loud.

### 13 <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nefe/You-Dont-Need-jQuery">You-Dont-Need-jQuery</a>

Frontend environments evolve rapidly nowadays and modern browsers have already implemented a great deal of DOM/BOM APIs which are good enough for production use. We don't have to learn jQuery from scratch for DOM manipulation or event handling. In the meantime, thanks to the spread of frontend libraries such as React, Angular and Vue, manipulating the DOM directly becomes anti-pattern, so that jQuery usage has never been less important. This project summarizes most of the alternatives in native Javascript implementation to jQuery methods, with IE 10+ support.

### 37 <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws">og-aws</a>

Amazon Web Services — a practical guide
A lot of information on AWS is already written. Most people learn AWS by reading a blog or a “getting started guide” and referring to the standard AWS references. Nonetheless, trustworthy and practical information and recommendations aren’t easy to come by. AWS’s own documentation is a great but sprawling resource few have time to read fully, and it doesn’t include anything but official facts, so omits experiences of engineers. The information in blogs or Stack Overflow is also not consistently up to date.

<p>This guide is by and for engineers who use AWS. It aims to be a useful, living reference that consolidates links, tips, gotchas, and best practices. It arose from discussion and editing over beers by several engineers who have used AWS extensively.
